								<p>Having completed work experience at BT Tower, I have been given an insight into the equipment and level of expertise that is needed
									 to ensure millions of people across the country are able to watch what they want, when they want, with as little downtime as possible.
									Furthermore, it highlighted to me the importance of team-work and cooperation to ensure that BT can provide the best possible experience for the end user.</p>

									<h3>Briliant Club</h3>
									<p>I have been involved in The Brilliant Club course. This involves a great level of academic thinking as we were tasked with researching our assigned topic then 1500 word essay that would be marked by an undergraduate student.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-chalkboard-teacher">
									<h3>Peer Based Intervention</h3>
									<p>I attended a Peer-based intervention, where we were tasked by our head of learning with helping less able students in all years.
										We helped them complete homework and other extra-curricular tasks in order to help boost their progress in class.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-code">
									<h3>A Passion for Coding</h3>
									<p>In my free time, I develop websites and code programs in order to improve and refine my programing ability.
										I am fluent in HTML, CSS and Python and through this I hope to prepare myself for a future career in Computer Science.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-book">
									<h3>Expanding my knowledge</h3>
									<p>In my spare time, I enjoy reading and learning about my favourite subjects (those being maths and computer science). Due to building upon my knowledge beyond the classroom, I am able to further my interest and passion for these subjects and thus allowing me to be more perceptive when it comes to exams and talking about these subjects.</p>
